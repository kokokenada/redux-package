# redux-package
Organize redux code into distinct units for better organize and re-use, reduce boiler plate.

Here is a blog post about the idea: https://fabricatech.wordpress.com/2017/05/15/reusable-redux-packages-an-approach-to-framework-insulation-and-code-reuse/ 

# Roadmap
- Can library be enhanced so packages be written to work with NgRx and Redux?
- Build collection of re-usable and installable redux packages

# Build
- npm run build

## Alternatives

- https://github.com/sarmadsangi/redux-module
